# 🕍 Scene 8: Underground Sanctuary (The Trials of Stone)
You step into a vast underground chamber, the air thick with dust and the faint hum of ancient magic.  Massive stone pillars rise to the ceiling, engraved with runes glowing softly in blue and gold.  Your footsteps echo across the chamber as you move cautiously forward.  At the center, a **fragment of the Earth Crystal** hovers above a carved pedestal.  Its light pulses in rhythm with your heartbeat.  Without thinking, you reach out — and the crystal **activates an ancient seal**, sending waves of energy through the room.  
The floor trembles, and a spiral of light rises from the pedestal. The seal reacts to **both your strength and the magic beyond the wall**, opening a path deeper into the labyrinth.
