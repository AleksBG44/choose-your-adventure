# 🏠 Scene 2a: Tavern

"Well met adventurer"

You make your way to the group of men at your first opportunity. The men size you up as you approach. How do you greet them?

- 🧙‍♂️ [Tell them about your arcane gifts and make the case that you could be of great help.](./S-scene3a)
- 🐍 [Attempt to decieve them by nodding as you pass and taking a seat at at a near by table.](./S-scene3b)
