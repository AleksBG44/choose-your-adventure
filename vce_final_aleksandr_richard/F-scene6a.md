# 🔮 Scene 6A: The Rune Passage
The deeper you go, the stronger the humming from the walls becomes. Strange glowing runes pulse softly in blue and gold, lighting the narrow corridor. As you move, **shadows flicker behind the symbols** — almost like they’re alive.  
Suddenly, a rune flares red, and **a barrage of stone darts** shoot from the walls! Then you hear it — **a faint voice chanting** beyond the stone. Someone is nearby. Someone using magic.
