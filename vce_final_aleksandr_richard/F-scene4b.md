# 🪨 Scene 4B: Main Entrance to the Caves of Echoes
And now you have reached that very cave. The entrance is huge, and you wonder how people didn't know about this place before. Only at the entrance is a strange name scratched out: **“Caves of Echoes”**. The entrance seems ordinary, but you feel something strange when you look inside the cave.
