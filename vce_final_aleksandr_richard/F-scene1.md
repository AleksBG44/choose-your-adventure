# 🏠 Scene 1: Tavern

It's a particularly noisy evening in the tavern today. You can hear people around you having fun and drinking, and once again you hear stories about some kind of crystal. But this time, a strange old man approaches your table. He places a **dusty scroll** on it and unfolds it in front of you. As soon as you glance at the scroll, the man disappears.
