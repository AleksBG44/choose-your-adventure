# ⚔️ Scene 7A: Clash of the Stone Guardians
Their hollow eyes glow with **ancient rune-light**,  and the ground shakes with each step they take. You ready your blade.mThe air is thick with dust and echoes of the past. Steel clashes with stone — sparks scatter like fireflies. You dodge one strike, counter another, but the tunnel begins to collapse around you. 
Amidst the chaos, you see a **cracked rune circle** on the floor —  its light pulsing like a heartbeat.
