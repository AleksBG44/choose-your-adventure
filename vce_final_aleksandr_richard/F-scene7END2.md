# 💀 Buried by the Guardians
> “Perhaps another will find your blade... and finish what you began.”

The guardians close in — stone and rune, moving as one.You swing your blade again and again, shattering fragments of their armor,but more hands of **living stone** rise from the dust to grab you. The last thing you see is a **wall of stone** rushing toward you,  followed by eternal silence.
